### Description
I implemented my HMM by attempting to do as much work as possible before the problem began. 
I created a transition matrix of the odds of getting from one square to another for all squares. 
I implemented a 1D list of squares, starting from the bottom left and going to the top right, along with functions to convert 1D to 2D and back. 
This made iterating much, much simpler.
I used the Maze.py file from PA2, with a few minor modifications to account for letters as squares.


### Evaluation
My results almost perfectly matched the results posted in the Slack, with what amounts to a few rounding errors of difference. 
I'm not sure why it's not exactly the same, but the results are clearly meaningful.
